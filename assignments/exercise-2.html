Throughout the assignment, you will:</p> <ul> <li>Practice writing functions with names (e.g. <em>named functions</em>) and without names (e.g. <em>anonymous functions</em>)</li> <li>Practice the process of <em>abstraction</em> by relying on your work from Exercise 1</li> <li>Practice translating mathematical expressions into code</li> </ul> <p>One of the core principles in computer science is <strong>abstraction</strong>–masking the “details” of how something works and instead just assuming that it works the way someone says it does. We’ve actually done quite a bit of this already; now we’re just giving it a name. For example, we don’t know <em>exactly</em> how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circle</code> produces a circle. We just know that if we give it the inputs it asks for, that it does <em>something</em> that makes a circle of that type appear.</p> <details> <summary>Why is abstraction important?</summary> Well here's a farfetched example...<br><br> Imagine you're in charge of a company that designs air planes. How do you think your boss would react if you designed a plane that could fly from O'Hare to JFK in New York one single time before having to be replaced? Your passengers get on the plane, fly to New York, and then that plane is toast–a completely one-off machine. <br><br> Now surely you see a problem here. No one is going to want to buy your plane if it can only be used once.<br><br> So you decide to redesign it so it's re-usuable...but now it's only usable between O'Hare and JFK. It can't fly to any other airports...<br><br> Still no one wants to buy your plane. Is the market rigged? Or is the product you've designed too limited? You go back and redo your design so that the plane is capable of lots reuse <b>and</b> it can be flown to any destination less than 2000 miles away. <br><br> Now your planes are flying off the shelves. This example, though ridiculous, is a demonstration of the process of abstraction. Your first design worked, but only a single time. Then you refined it so that it could be re-used. Then you refined it even further so that it could be re-used <i>across a variety of contexts</i>. <br><br> When we write programs <b>we are (usually) not trying to design software that can only be used once for one specific thing</b>. Instead we are aiming to build <b>powerful and flexible</b> computational machines that can handle a variety of inputs. That way, we can start to <i>think with our machine in mind</i> (i.e. we know how this part of the task can be solved because our program can solve it) and move on to other and/or larger tasks. </details> <p>This assignment will give you practice with the process of abstracting programs. You’ll begin by writing very basic code, then gradually building up layers of abstraction to:</p> <ul> <li>mask complexity</li> <li>minimize repetition</li> <li>and write <em>reusable</em> and <em>generalizable</em> patterns.</li> </ul> <p>We’ve provided some starter code for you in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exercise_2.rkt</code> file. For all questions in this assignment, the starter code has examples of the image you’re trying to produce. We’ve also provided a <strong>library file</strong> called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-images.rkt</code>. This file holds definitions of several functions you’ll need to use during this assignment. You don’t have to look at the code in this file, but you do need to make sure that both files (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exercise_2.rkt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-images.rkt</code>) are in the same folder on your computer.</p> <details> <summary>Click here if you're on Windows</summary> These files are provided in the ZIP file. You have to extract that zip file before editing. On a Mac double click on the ZIP file to expand. On <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5#:~:text=To%20unzip%20a%20single%20file,and%20then%20follow%20the%20instructions" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Windows</a> and <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-zip-unzip-files-on-chromebook-4799535" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ChromeOS</a>, for some reason they allow you to open these files in what's called READ-ONLY mode (in the bottom right hand corner of DrRacket will be a yellow box that says READ ONLY). Don't do that! Instead, first extract all the files into your <code>cs111</code> folder and THEN start working. </details> <details> <summary>Error loading iterated-images.rkt</summary> First, check to see that <code>iterated-images.rkt</code> and your <code>tutorial_2.rkt</code> file are in the same folder on your computer. Second, make sure that the file you have open is actually the one you intended to open (close DrRacket then re-open your tutorial file.) Third, if you're on a Mac, you may have gotten a popup asking for permission to access a folder on your computer. If you said no...then DrRacket can't read your file. You can fix it by going to System Settings (or System Preferences), selecting the Privacy &amp; Security tab, looking for the FILES AND FOLDERS option, and checking all of the options under DrRacket. </details> <p><br> <a class="nu-button" href="https://bain-cs111.github.io/course-files/exercises/exercise_2_template.zip" target="_blank"> Exercise 2 Starter Files <i class="fas fa-download"></i> </a></p> <blockquote> <p><em>Note:</em> Like the last assignment, we’ve tried hard to provide instructions for those who have a difficult time seeing colors. Please let us know if any of the questions cause you issues.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2> <p>Start by opening the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exercise_2.rkt</code> file. At the top of the definitions file you’ll see two <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require</code> statements. Each asks Dr Racket to <strong>import</strong> or load some external libraries (just like checking out a book from a real library):</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">require</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="nv">htdp/image</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">require</span> <span class="s">"./iterated-images.rkt"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The second line should look familiar, it loads the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code> library from our auxillary textbook “<strong>H</strong>ow <strong>t</strong>o <strong>D</strong>esign <strong>P</strong>rograms (<strong>2</strong>E).” The second line asks DrRacket to load in the library we provided in your homework download. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./</code> says “please look in the same folder as the file we’re currently editing” while the second part is the name of the file to load. We’ve written the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require</code> commands for you for this assignment but you will need to understand how they’re importing code for future assignments.</p> <p>When you run the file for the first time, a window will pop up saying that all of your tests failed. Don’t panic. You haven’t programmed anything yet! If you look through the test window, you’ll see that a number of different named tests failed. For now, you can close the test report window and carry on but this window gives you important information as to <em>why</em> each test failed.</p> <hr> <h3 id="testing">Testing</h3> <p>The starter code contains a series of <strong>unit tests</strong>: pieces of the program that test your code against sets of expected results. When you run your code by clicking the “Run” button or Ctrl + R (Cmd + R on Mac), DrRacket will run the tests and generate a report of what tests succeeded and failed. If any tests failed, they’ll pop up in a window. Read the window to see what happened, <mark>do not just close it!</mark> To troubleshoot your output, you’ll need to compare your image results to the expected results.</p> <p>To experiment with this assignment, you have two options.</p> <h4 id="option-1">Option 1</h4> <p>You can work directly in the Definitions Window. Whenever you want to test what you’ve written, just run the file, which will generate a testing report in a popup window.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you want to work on one part of the homework at a time, select any tests you don’t want to run, and click Racket &gt; Comment Out With semicolons (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code>). Racket ignores anything that comes after a semicolon when it runs your program, so you won’t get notified if those tests fail. When you’re ready to tackle those parts of the assignment, highlight the commented-out region and click Racket &gt; Uncomment to restore the code. <strong>Don’t forget to uncomment and run all your tests before you submit</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="option-2">Option 2</h4> <p>Alternatively, you can work in the the Read/Evaluate/Print Loop (from now on, we’ll call it the <strong>REPL</strong>), aka the Interactions Window. The REPL is nice for fiddling with your code without having to continually re-run the file, and you can hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">escape + p</code> on your keyboard to repeat your previous command if you want to make adjustments. Keep doing this until you get the result you’re looking for. Once you’re satisfied with your results, paste your code into the Definitions Window in the appropriate place.</p> <p>If there’s an error in your code in the Definitions Window then nothing from the Definitions Window will work in the Interactions Window until you fix the error and hit the Run button again. For example all of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-*</code> functions from our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-images</code> library won’t be there! So it’s usually best to write one function at a time and test each one as your write it rather than writing all of it at once and then start trying to fix it.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Tip</strong>: It’s almost NEVER a good idea to tackle “all” of something at once when it comes to programming. Instead, make small sub-goals for yourself and attack each sub-goal first. For example, remember in Exercise 1 when we made a circle overlaid on another circle? Sure, you could tackle that all at once. But you could also create small sub-goals like 1. create a small red circle; 2. create a large blue circle; 3. overlay red circle on top of blue circle. That way, if you run into an issue in any one particular sub goal, you know it’s due to something in that specific section of your program.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <h2 id="part-1-iterative-expressions">Part 1: Iterative Expressions</h2> <p>In this section, we’ll use three iterator functions: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-overlay</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-beside</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-below</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-above</code>. We covered these functions in class so checkout the lecture slides and recording for details.</p> <p>For this part of the homework, we’ve provided placeholders or <strong>stubs</strong> for your code. Just look for the line that says something like:</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define</span> <span class="nv">question-1</span> <span class="s">"fill this in"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>and replace the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string</code> “fill this in” with your answer. This will allow the tests to find your code.</p> <hr> <h3 id="question-1-a-simple-bullseye">Question 1: A Simple Bullseye</h3> <h4 id="part-a">Part A</h4> <p>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">overlay</code> to generate a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"red"</code> bullseye consisting of five concentric circles. The smallest circle should have a radius of 10, and the largest should have a radius of 50. The circles should be an even distance apart.</p> <h4 id="part-b">Part B</h4> <p>Now use iterated-overlay to generate an image identical to your result from Part (a). Remember that iterators begin counting at 0, not 1, which means you may need to adjust your math slightly to avoid creating a circle with zero radius. If you’re getting something like the figure below, that’s probably what’s happening to you:</p> <p><img src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/exercise_2/question-1b-issue.png" alt="Possible issue with Q1B" style="size: 25%;"></p> <hr> <h3 id="question-2-octagonal-snowman">Question 2: Octagonal Snowman</h3> <p>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-above</code> to generate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowman" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">snowman</a> made out of 4 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"purple"</code> octagons.

This flower should be similar to the previous one, except that each ellipse should have an alpha value of 128, meaning that the colors of the different ellipses will blend with the colors below them. Remember that alpha is the fourth argument to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">color</code> function!</p> <p>You must use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interpolate-colors</code> in your implementation, starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red</code> and ending with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blue</code>. Remember that iteration starts at 0, so if you call an iterator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> times, the final iteration will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n-1</code>. You may need to adjust your math to make sure the fifth iteration is completely blue.</p> <details> <summary>Need help with interpolate-colors?</summary> See Tutorial 2 for more details on this function. </details> <p>Start by writing your answer to use an alpha value of 255 and see if you can make it look like “midway” test image provided.

In this section, you will write reusable functions to generate images from some template, but with even more flexibility.</p> <p>Whenever you write a function, you should start by writing two comments: a <strong>signature</strong> and a <strong>purpose statement</strong>.</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>signature</strong> defines the <em>name</em> of the function, then a colon (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:</code>), its input arguments in order, an arrow (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-&gt;</code>), and then the type of <strong>return value</strong> (or output). It should almost read as an icebreaker statement for the function: “Hello, my name is doubler and I expect one number and then give you back a number.”</li> <li>The <strong>purpose statement</strong> is a brief human-readable description of what the function does.</li> </ul> <p>Here’s what that looks like in practice:</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; doubler : number -&gt; number</span>

That way, there's no possible way to submit an older file. </details> <details> <summary>Pro-Tip 2</summary> Do not have multiple versions of the same file. It just makes it harder for you to keep track of what's what. </details> <details> <summary>Pro-Tip 3</summary> Worried you didn't submit the right file? It takes seconds to check! Once you've successfully submitted on Cavnas, just download the file you just submitted by clicking on the link Canvas provides. Then open that file in DrRacket. Is it the right one? If so, you're good to go! There are more specific answers in the submissions details section below. If you want to RUN the file inside your downloads folder, keep in mind you would need to copy the <code>iterated-images.rkt</code> file into your Downloads folder as well. </details> <details> <summary>How do I get feedback on my submission?</summary> You'll receive two bits of feedback on your submissions in this class. The first is what we call a TypeCheck which happens every 30 minutes and just checks to make sure you submitted a valid Racket file and that you've defined each of the things we've asked of you in the assignment. You'll see this as a Canvas comment on your submission no more than 30 minutes after you submit. The second is your actual graded feedback. You will not receive a grade/final feedback from the autograder on your assignment until AFTER the final due date (which is the <mark>UNTIL</mark> date on Canvas). </details> <hr> <h2 id="submission-details">Submission Details</h2> <details> <summary><a href="https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/220479/pages/drracket-cheatsheet-2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DrRacket Cheat Sheet</a></summary> </details> <details> <summary><a href="https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/220479/pages/checking-for-syntax-or-runtime-errors-in-racket-2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Checking for Errors</a></summary> </details> <details> <summary><a href="https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/220479/pages/exercise-submission-+-grading-faq-2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Submission FAQ</a></summary> </details> <details> <summary><a href="https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/220479/pages/autograder-and-submission-faq-2" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Autograder FAQ</a></summary> </details> <details> <summary><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScm1haEI_pQhprNryZ5ckbFZi_LU5MCtasW86RSHCCqSuc3Zw/viewform?usp=sf_link" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Late Penalty Waiver</a></summary> </details> </div> </article> </body> </html>
