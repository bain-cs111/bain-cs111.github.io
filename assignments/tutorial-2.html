To set up this tutorial, download the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial_2.zip</code>. Ensure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-images.rkt</code> is in the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial_2</code> folder as your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial_2.rkt</code> file. Throughout, you will practice defining functions that depend on the functions from this library in order to create more complicated images than in Tutorial 0.</p> <details> <summary>How to use ZIP Files</summary> These files are provided in the ZIP file. You have to extract that zip file before editing. On a Mac double click on the ZIP file to expand. On <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5#:~:text=To%20unzip%20a%20single%20file,and%20then%20follow%20the%20instructions" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Windows</a> and <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-zip-unzip-files-on-chromebook-4799535" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ChromeOS</a>, for some reason they allow you to open these files in what's called READ-ONLY mode (in the bottom right hand corner of DrRacket will be a yellow box that says READ ONLY). Don't do that! Instead, first extract all the files into your `cs111` folder and THEN start working. </details> <details> <summary>Error loading iterated-images.rkt</summary> First, check to see that <code>iterated-images.rkt</code> and your <code>tutorial_2.rkt</code> file are in the same folder on your computer. Second, make sure that the file you have open is actually the one you intended to open (close DrRacket then re-open your tutorial file.) Third, if you're on a Mac, you may have gotten a popup asking for permission to access a folder on your computer. If you said no...then DrRacket can't read your file. You can fix it by going to System Settings (or System Preferences), selecting the Privacy &amp; Security tab, looking for the FILES AND FOLDERS option, and checking all of the options under DrRacket. </details> <p><br> <a class="nu-button" href="https://bain-cs111.github.io/course-files/tutorials/tutorial_2_template.zip" target="_blank"> Tutorial 2 Starter Files <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a> <br> <br></p> <hr> <h2 id="testing-code">Testing Code</h2> <p>Over the past couple of weeks, odds are you’ve been manually checking your programs using the REPL (i.e. run your function and manually compare the output to what you expected it to be by eye). However, this very quickly becomes a) annoying and b) quite difficult to do with images (can you tell the difference between a circle with radius 50 and a circle with radius 51?). So instead of doing things manually, we can augment our program with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code>s to test our program..well…programmatically!</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code> is a function that tests to see if the output of its first argument equals the output of the second argument. These are usually typed in the Definitions Window so that whenever you run your program, it also runs the tests you’ve written.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: in this class, we’ll generally refer to these as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code>s, but elsewhere in the wide world of computer science these might be referred to as “tests” or “unit tests.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code> is a just a function with two inputs, we use the usual notation to call the function:</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">check-expect</span> <span class="nv">expression</span>
              <span class="nv">expected-expression</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>For example, this check-expect would pass:</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">check-expect</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
                   <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Once the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code> runs, the REPL pane would return “The test passed!” Otherwise, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code> will return a report of which tests failed, displaying both the actual and expected outputs. For instance, try the following and see what you get:</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">check-expect</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">+1</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
                  <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code> is a function that returns a <em>boolean</em> object. Booleans can have one of two values: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#true</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#false</code>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Throughout this assignment, we’ll ask you to both run some pre-made <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code>s as well as design your own to check your functions as you write them.</p> <hr> <h2 id="part-1-my-row">Part 1. my-row</h2> <p>Having already written some functions to produce images in the last tutorial, we are now going to write some <strong>iterations</strong> that will make our code more efficient at making complicated images. Let’s start with a simple function that will display multiple copies of an image next to each other, called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-row</code>.</p> <p>You are going to try and create a row of circles of a fixed size using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-beside</code>, which is a function that takes as input a function and a count, and then displays an image defined by the inputted function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> times (e.g. if you passed in a function call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circle</code> and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code> it would place 5 identical circles next to each other).</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define</span> <span class="nv">my-row</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">λ</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">image</span> <span class="nv">count</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">iterated-beside</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">λ</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">image-number</span><span class="p">)</span>
                        <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
                     <span class="nv">count</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>When you think you’ve got it, make sure to uncomment the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code> for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-row</code> function (i.e. delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#|</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|#</code> that currently surround the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code> function call) and run your program to see if it matches the expected output.</p> <p>Note that just because it works for those blue circles doesn’t mean it works for all other cases. Make sure to try your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-row</code> function with some different inputs that aren’t blue circles to make sure it work the way you expect it to.</p> <hr> <h2 id="part-2-my-grid">Part 2. my-grid</h2> <p>Now that you’ve got a working <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-row</code> function, let’s use it to make an even more complicated image: a complete grid of whatever image someone inputs to our function. For example, say I wanted to make a grid (5 wide and 5 high) of outlined green circles:</p> <p><img src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/tutorial_2/my-grid.svg" alt="My Grid Example" style="width:33%"></p> <p>Use your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-row</code> function as well as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-above</code> function to generate a square-grid of any inputted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code>. Call the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-grid</code>.</p> <details> <summary>What is iterated-above?</summary> It's literally a version of the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html#%28def._%28%28lib._2htdp%2Fimage..rkt%29._above%29%29" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">built-in <code>above</code> function</a> that can be iterated. If you think of the <code>overlay</code> function, it does the following in English: "overlay shape 1 on top of shape 2 on on top of shape 3 on top of shape 4, etc..." The same is true of `above`: "place shape 1 above shape 2, which is above shape 3, which is above shape 4, etc..." Since you're creating identical rows this isn't so important at the moment, but it will be important later. </details> <p>Similar to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-row</code> function since the size of the shapes and rows aren’t changing, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-grid</code> function shouldn’t use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> variable to change anything about the shape or the row length. This function will take in an image and a number (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code>) and output a grid of images of size <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n * n</code>.</p> <details> <summary>Hint!</summary> This might seem easy on its face...but it's very easy to get bogged down in parentheses. If you get stuck, try using your code from <code>my-row</code> as a sort of "iterator template." In <code>my-row</code> you were just drawing a simple shape using whatever <i>image</i> was inputted. You're doing the same thing here, except instead of just drawing the inputted <i>image</i>, you're drawing a <code>my-row</code> of <i>image</i>s! </details> <p><strong>Just because your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-grid</code> function works on the green circles DOES NOT mean it is correctly written (even it passes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check-expect</code>).</strong> Try making a grid of blue circles using your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-grid</code> function before moving on.</p> <p>By using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-row</code> function inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-grid</code>, you’re practicing the key concept of <strong>abstraction</strong>. Once you’ve made a function to create a row of images, you no longer need to remember all those details–you just call the function! Once you’ve created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-grid</code>, you don’t need to worry about ever writing it again–you just call the function! In a way, you’re creating larger and larger Lego bricks you can later combine into even more complex programs.</p> <hr> <h2 id="part-3-my-bullsye">Part 3. my-bullsye</h2> <p>Remember that all iterators have a built-in counter variable that start at 0 and end at n-1. That is, they will run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> times, but at their first iteration, their counter will be 0, then 1, then 2, and so on. They will then stop once the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n - 1</code> iteration has finished its business.</p> <p>For your next image, you are going to try and recreate a bullseye made out of purple-outlined circles with radii increasing by 25 each time. This function, called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-bullseye</code>, will take one input, the number of circles to draw, and will involve <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-overlay</code>. The output should look something like this.</p> <p><img src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/tutorial_2/my-bullseye.svg" alt="Bullseye Example" style="width:20%"></p> <p>Notice that there is a tiny little speck in the middle of the bullseye example. What could <em>that</em> be?  </p> <details> <summary>Answer...</summary> Remember the iteration counter starts at 0 (just like our exercises and tutorials started out at 0). In this bullseye and all the circles in the bullseye have a radius of their circle-number multiplied by a constant - in this case, 25 - then this must mean that the little speck in the middle of the circle is another circle, but with a radius of 0. </details> <hr> <h2 id="part-4-my-pyramid">Part 4. my-pyramid</h2> <p>Next, you are going to try to create a pyramid with a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-pyramid</code> to create some awesome pyramids that would put Giza to shame.</p> <p><img src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/tutorial_2/my-pyramid.svg" alt="My Grid Example" style="width:20%"></p> <p>You are going to want to use a structure something similar to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-grid</code> function for this, but this time, change the length of the rows on each iteration (just like you changed the size of each circle in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-bullseye</code>).</p> <details> <summary>Remember...</summary> Remember that <code>iterated-above</code> places "shape 1 on above shape 2, which is above shape 3, which is above shape 4, etc..." What this means is that if you think about building your pyramid from bottom-to-top...you might actually get a flipped pyramid. If this happens to you, try to think about building it from top-to-bottom. </details> <p>This function should take as inputs an image and a number (<i>n</i>) and then output an image of a pyramid with height <i>n</i> and base <i>n</i> made out of the input image. This will allow you to build a pyramid with any image you want and any size with literally just a few lines of a program. <em>Abstraction is SO cool.</em></p> <hr> <h2 id="rgba-colors">RGB(A) Colors</h2> <p>Like we explored last week, colors can also be represented in a format called <strong>RGB</strong>. The exact details of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">how RGB works</a> are beyond the scope of this course, but you can think of a color as a list of three values between 0 and 255, each member of which corresponds to the amount of red, green, and blue light it contains.</p> <details> <summary>Some Examples!</summary> <ul> <li>"blue" is (0 0 255). Notice that this color has zero red light, zero green light, and full blue light.</li> <li>"black" is (0 0 0). This color has zero red, green, and blue light.</li> <li>"white" is (255 255 255). This color has the maximum amount of light of red, green, and blue light.</li> </ul> </details> <p>In Racket, we denote RGB colors with the color function which has a type signature of the below</p> <pre>
;; color: number number number -&gt; color
(color <i>red-light  green-light  blue-light</i>)
</pre> <p>where each of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red-light</code>, etc. is a number between 0 and 255. So we can replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"blue"</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(color 0 0 255)</code> as demonstrated by the following REPL session:</p> <p><img src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/exercise_2/RGB-REPL-1.png" alt="REPL with RGB colors" style="width: 33%;"></p> <p>Returning to the flower you wrote in the previous question, change the color <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"blue"</code> in the ellipse definition to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(color 0 0 255)</code>. The test should still pass.</p> <p>Since we can represent colors numerically, we can also use simple math to <em>change</em> colors. For example, increasing a color’s red-light value by 150 will make it 150 units more red:</p> <p><img src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/exercise_2/RGB-REPL-2.png" alt="REPL with Changing RGB colors" style="width: 33%;"></p> <p>We can also control the <strong>opacity</strong> of a color by adding a fourth number, known as the <strong>alpha value</strong>. The alpha value is a number between 0 (completely transparent) and 255 (completely opaque). Once you add an alpha value to an RGB color, you’re using the <strong>RGBA format</strong> (the A stands for “alpha”).</p> <p><img src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/exercise_2/RGBA-REPL.png" alt="REPL with RGBA colors" style="width: 33%;"></p> <p>Note that the Racket <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">color</code> function takes either three or four numbers. If you only supply three, Racket assumes you want a fully opaque color, so the alpha value will <strong>default</strong> to 255.</p> <hr> <h2 id="interpolate-colors">interpolate-colors</h2> <p>Now that we have iterators that allow us to generate more complex images, we probably want a way of generating colors. Manually calculating RGB shade differences can be, well…annoying. Since the disciplinary purpose of computer science is to help programmers be productive once to enable future laziness, we now introduce a new function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interpolate-colors</code>, which provides a much easier way to blend two colors:</p> <pre>
;; interpolate-colors: color color number -&gt; color
(interpolate-colors <i>color-1 color-2 fraction</i>)
</pre> <p>where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fraction</code> is a number between 0 and 1, which denotes how much to blend the two colors. Using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fraction</code> of 0 just returns <em>color-1</em>, and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fraction</code> of 1 just returns <em>color-2</em>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Important Note</strong>: you can find the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html#%28def._%28%28lib._2htdp%2Fimage..rkt%29._image-color~3f%29%29" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">list of built-in colors in the documentation</a>. To blend other colors (or colors with different transparency), use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">color</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make-color</code> functions described above and in the lecture slides.</p> </blockquote> <p>Just as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iterated-overlay</code> abstracts away the tedium of calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">overlay</code> with ten basically identical circles, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interpolate-colors</code> abstracts away the math of computing the RGB difference between two colors.</p> <hr> <h2 id="part-5-color-fun">Part 5. Color Fun</h2> <p>Write a new version of your bullseye function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-bullseye/color</code> that’s similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-bullseye</code> but with a few major differences:</p> <ol> <li>The function should have two additional inputs called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start-color</code> (2nd input) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">end-color</code> (3rd input).</li> <li>The circles should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"solid"</code>.</li> <li>The inner-most circle should be of size 25 instead of 0 (with the same increasing radius as before)</li> <li>The inner-most circle should be the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start-color</code> </li> <li>The succeeding circles should be evenly interpolated (i.e. 0%, 10%, etc…) between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start-color</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">end-color</code> </li> <li>The outer-most circle should be the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">end-color</code> </li> </ol> <p>This one is tricky.
