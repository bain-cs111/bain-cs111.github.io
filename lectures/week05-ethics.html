Topics in this module will include universal design principles, accessibility standards and regulations, and the role of technology companies in promoting accessibility.</p> <hr> <h2 id="part-1---complete-the-pre-discussion-activity">Part 1 - Complete the Pre-Discussion Activity</h2> <p>Everyone is required to complete this pre-discussion activity. Please watch (or listen) to to Judy Brewer’s (<em>Turing Award</em> Winner and former WAI Director of the W3C) TEDxMIT talk on <em>Creating an Accessible Digital Future</em>.</p> <p>As you watch, consider the tools you use everyday. Are all accessible to those with visual, auditory, or mobility impairments? What about those with cognitive impairments? Could these tools be redesigned to be moved towards being universally accessible?</p> <hr> <h2 id="part-2---attend-your-discussion-section">Part 2 - Attend your Discussion Section</h2> <p>You should have registered for a discussion section this week by joining the appropriate Canvas group. Switching sessions is not allowed (unless there is a direct academic conflict or emergency) and attendance at your registered section is required and you must be in-attendance <em>for the entirety of the session</em>. For questions about discussion sections please post on edSTEM (if it’s a general question) or email Prof. Bain (<a href="mailto:connor.bain@northwestern.edu">connor.bain@northwestern.edu</a>) if it’s specific to your case.</p> <hr> <h2 id="part-3---submit-your-self-reflection">Part 3 - Submit your Self Reflection</h2> <p>After attending your discussion section, be sure to return here to complete this self-reflection. Reflect on your discussion section in 200 to 300 words. Specifically, consider one new insight or perspective you gained from our discussion on accessibility in technology, and how might you apply this insight to your future work or personal life.</p> <p>Additionally, please provide any feedback you have on how the discussion went.</p> <hr> <h3 style="padding-top:15px;" id="readings">1.
