Students are asked explore different “topic modules” that introduce broad topics in ethics.</p> <p>Students must engage in 3 ethics related activities during the quarter:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>One introductory module</strong> (this assignment) which covers the ethics of social media and introduces a framework for thinking about the impact of certain technologies.</li> <li> <strong>Attendance at one topic module</strong> that students will select based on topic interest and availability. They will complete a short reading beforehand in order to be ready to discuss the topic and complete a short reflection after attending.</li> <li> <strong>One final reflection module</strong> which asks students to reflect on their engagement with ethical issues and their relationship to technology by producing a short write-up comparing and contrasting the topics that students learned in topic modules (asynchronous during Week 11).</li> </ul> <p>This first module serves as an introduction <strong>and is required for everyone</strong>. You have three tasks for this module:</p> <ol> <li>You must watch the short introductory video about ethics and Social Media Algorithms linked below.</li> <li>You must complete this Canvas assignment which is a short reflection about the topics presented in the video.</li> <li>You must sign-up for <strong>1 additional topic module</strong> sometime during the quarter. More details below. <mark>You will receive a 0 for this assignment if you do not sign-up for a topics module by Sunday, Oct 6 at 11:59pm.</mark> </li> </ol> <hr> <h2 id="signing-up-for-a-discussion-section">Signing Up for a Discussion Section</h2> <p>Each week throughout the quarter (beginning in Week 3 and ending in Week 9), our Peer Mentor staff will lead Ethics Topics Modules. The 7 available modules are listed below:</p> <ul> <li>Week 3 - Sustainability – How technology can promote sustainable futures and also has a large footprint itself</li> <li>Week 4 - Bias – Reflecting on bias in artificial intelligence</li> <li>Week 5 - Accessibility – Analyzing how technology can be designed for all audiences while also widening the digital divide</li> <li>Week 6 - Accountability – An exploration of the Boeing 737 Max tragedy and scandal</li> <li>Week 7 - Impact – Exploring how technology impacts individuals, communities, and societies</li> <li>Week 8 - Labor – Analyzing how technology is producing new forms of labor and exploitation</li> <li>Week 9 - Identity – Navigating the complex terrain of technology and personal identity</li> </ul> <p>Your job is to select a module that appeals to you (or works for your schedule that week). Each module will be offered approximately 6 times through its respective week and enrollment in each session is capped at 12 students. You can view the available session dates &amp; times below.
