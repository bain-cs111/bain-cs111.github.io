; Basic If Example
;(define u 5)
;(if (= u 5)
;    "u equals 5"
;    "u doesn't equal 5")

; Proof that if is a special form
;(if (= 1 1) 6 (/ 6 0))

;;; Compound Predicates
(define f 2)
(define g 3)

;; OR Demo - "Are any of these things true?"
;(or (= f 2)
;    (= g 3)
;    (= g 5))

;; AND Demo - "Are *all* of these things true?"
;(and (= f 2)
;     (= g 5)
;     (= g 3))

;; NOT Demo - "What's the opposite of this predicate?"
;(not (= f 2))
;(not (= g 4))


; tricky local example
;(define a #true)
;(local [(define a #false)]
