While they’re useful to practice <em>test taking skills</em>, they aren’t representative of “studying” the underlying material.</p> <h2 id="advice">Advice</h2> <ul> <li>When you take a practice test…<strong>actually take it</strong>. <ul> <li>Set aside the prescribed test time</li> <li>Take it in a quiet place</li> <li>Only use the materials you’ll be allowed in the actual exam</li> <li>Most importantly <strong>do not look at the solutions until you written some answer down</strong> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Just because you solved a problem on a practice exam <strong>does not</strong> show that you know how to identify that <em>class</em> of problem on an exam. <ul> <li>When you see a problem on a practice exam, try to brainstorm variations of problems you might see on the real exam.</li> <li>Would you know how to solve the question if it were asked in a different way?</li> <li>What if they included this variable, but not this other variable? Etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If you get problems wrong, identify <strong>why</strong> you got them wrong. <ul> <li>What about the problem led you down the wrong solution?</li> <li>What sort of strategy can you make to avoid that wrong path?</li> <li>How might you remember this mistake next time you have a similar problem?</li> </ul> </li> <li>While you can certainly ask Professors/TAs/PMs for advice on what extra material you might use to study <em>do not ask for extra practice exams</em> to be released. <ul> <li>Not only is it a huge amount of work to design an even-handed exam…but taking practice exams is <strong>NOT</strong> the only way of studying for an exam</li> <li>See if you can identify extra problems in the slides/lectures</li> <li>Try to explain one of the topics covered on the exam to your roommate</li> <li>Try to write your own questions based on the ones you see in the available practice exam</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </main> </div> </body> </html>
