If there are it downloads them and then runs a series of “type checks.” These basically consist of two things:</p> <ol> <li>Do each of the variable names we’ve asked you to specify actually have in them objects of the correct types.</li> <li>Do the built-in <code>check-expects</code> we gave you actually pass on your submitted file.</li> </ol> <p>Just like when it actually grades your code, it then posts the report of these tests to your Canvas assignment as a comment. <strong>Keep in mind, it is only a “sanity check” for your program. It does not guarantee a particular grade on the assignment.</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note</strong>: For function definitions, while we can check to see if you have the correct number of arguments, we have no way of checking the actual type requirements for these arguments. This makes the built-in <code>check-expects</code> very important for confirming your program actually works.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you resubmit after a type check run, ConnorBot will detect your new submission, retest the new file, and then send you the updated results.</p> <hr> <h2 id="how-does-auto-grading-work">How does auto-grading work?</h2> <p>The exercises will describe a set of definitions (typically functions) you need to write and what each function should do. We will prepare a set of ​<code>check-expects</code> to see if those functions run in the same way as required by the exercise. If the functions you write pass the tests we have prepared, you will receive full credit.</p> <p>For example, if the homework specifies:</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; Write a procedure add that takes two numbers and returns their sum.</span>
<span class="c1">;; add : number number -&gt; number</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define</span> <span class="nv">add</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">number1</span> <span class="nv">number2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">"fill me in"</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We might run your homework and test it with these <code>check-expects</code>:</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">check-expect</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>The set of ​<code>check-expects</code> that I’m using will not be disclosed beforehand. This is because you need to be considering whether or not your program works the way you designed it to work!</p> <hr> <h2 id="when-do-i-get-the-autograder-feedback">When do I get the Autograder feedback?</h2> <p>You’ll get it after the final deadline for the assignment via Canvas. This usually means 48ish hours after the regular deadline.</p> <hr> <h2 id="why-cant-i-see-the-results-of-my-code-when-i-put-them-inside-of-defines">Why can’t I see the results of my code when I put them inside of <code>defines</code> </h2> <p>Remember, <code>define</code> is a special form that asks Racket to associate a particular <em>name</em> with a particular <em>value</em>. <strong>Computers don’t do anything you don’t ask them to.</strong> <code>define</code> does not say to output anything; it just says associate these two things.</p> <p>If you want to display whatever is stored in your variable you created using <code>define</code>, then you either need to ask that object to be displayed as part of your program:</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define</span> <span class="nv">a-cool-circle</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">circle</span> <span class="mi">100</span> <span class="s">"outline"</span> <span class="s">"blue"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="nv">a-cool-circle</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>or alternatively, once you’ve run your definitions file, you can ask Racket to lookup the value of that variable in the Interactions Window (or REPL):</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">&gt;</span> <span class="nv">a-cool-circle</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <blockquote> <p>Note, we don’t use parentheses around the name here because it is NOT a function. It is a piece of data. It doesn’t need to be “called.”</p> </blockquote> <hr> <h2 id="make-sure-your-submission-runs-without-syntax-or-runtime-errors">Make sure your submission runs without syntax or runtime errors!</h2> <p>The auto-grader needs to ​run​ the file in order to grade it.</p> <ul> <li>If the file has ​any​ syntax error (missing or extra parens, wrong λ syntax), the auto-grader won’t be able to open it.</li> <li>If there’s ​any​ error showing up in Interaction Window when you click RUN the auto-grader won’t be able to run your file.</li> </ul> <p>In either situation, the auto-grader would not be able to assign partial credits.</p> <hr> <h2 id="follow-question-descriptions-literally">Follow question descriptions literally</h2> <p>Your code should follow the Exercise literally. More specifically,</p> <ul> <li>Function names (including ‘-‘ and ‘/’) must be spelled exactly the same as in descriptions. If the Exercise description asks for an image definition named <code>flag-of-chicago</code>, you cannot change it to <code>flag_of_chicago</code> or <code>flag-of-Chicago​</code>.</li> <li>The order of arguments should follow the literal order in Exercise descriptions. <ul> <li> <em>Example.</em> Implement​ <code>​iterated-any​</code>, that takes an arbitrary <code>combiner</code> function, a <code>generator</code> function, and a number of iterations, and produces…</li> <li>You should write a function with those three arguments <code>(lambda (combiner generator iteration-number)...)</code>, where <code>combiner​</code> is the combiner procedure, <code>generator​</code> is the generator procedure and <code>​iteration-number​</code> is the number of iterations.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Data type and the shape of values should match problem descriptions. If the homework description asks you to write a function that returns a list of album​s where an <code>album</code> is defined as <code>(define-struct album (title artist genre))</code>, you should not return a list of just album titles. <ul> <li>Example. If the homework description asks you to write a function that returns a list of paths, you should not return a list of strings.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="do-i-need-to-pass-all-the-included-tests">Do I need to pass all the included tests?</h2> <p>Yes. Of course, you can submit code that does not pass all tests. You will receive credit for all correct problems. However, the provided tests in the starter code at least check whether there are misspellings in function definitions. Therefore failing a test may indicate that there is a typo or that the code is not fully correct.</p> <hr> <h2 id="if-i-pass-all-check-expects-in-the-starter-code-will-i-receive-full-credit-is-my-code-correct">If I pass all ​check-expect​s in the starter code, will I receive full credit? Is my code correct?</h2> <p>No. We use our own set of <code>​check-expects</code> to grade submissions, not the provided ones in the starter code. However, a correct solution will have to pass all given <code>​check-expects</code>. Therefore any test failure indicates that there are some bugs in your solution.</p> <hr> <h2 id="do-i-need-to-upload-supplementary-files-iterated-imagesrkt-remove_duplicatesrkt-etc">Do I need to upload supplementary files iterated-images.rkt​, ​remove_duplicates.rkt​ etc?</h2> <p><strong>Upload only your work</strong>. We will have the supplementary files ready when grading.</p> <hr> <h2 id="testing-your-code">Testing Your Code</h2> <p>How do I test my submission?</p> <ol> <li>Download your submission from Canvas.</li> <li>Put the supplementary file like <code>iterated_images.rkt</code> or <code>remove_duplicates.rkt</code> in the same directory. Directly use the ones from the provided ZIP file.</li> <li>Open your submission. Click RUN in DrRacket.</li> <li>Ensure that there’s no error and the code passes all tests.</li> </ol> <hr> <h2 id="writing-your-own-tests">Writing Your Own Tests</h2> <p>You should always write new ​<code>check-expects</code> although we do not grade them. Directly write ​<code>check-expects</code> against the problem descriptions and make sure to follow all given instructions. As an example, if the homework specifies <em>“Write a function longer-than that takes a string, a number and returns if the length of the string is larger than the given number”</em></p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; longer-than : number string -&gt; boolean</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>You should first write ​check-expect​s like the following examples before attempting to finish ​<code>longer-than</code>​:</p> <div class="language-racket highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">check-expect</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">longer-than</span> <span class="s">"hello"</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="no">#false</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <hr> <h2 id="can-i-change-supplementary-files-in-the-starter-code">Can I change supplementary files in the starter code?</h2> <p>Don’t change it. We won’t be able to run your file.</p> <hr> <h2 id="can-i-add-new-require-lines">Can I add new ​require​ lines?</h2> <p>We have included necessary ​<code>(require ...)</code>​ lines in the starter code, so there should be no need to add or remove any ​<code>(require ...)</code>​ lines. In general, you can (only) include <strong>2htdp</strong> teachpacks (all of form &lt;​code&gt;(require 2htdp/…)&lt;/code&gt;) and the supplementary file from the same week. Don’t add any additional library outside this scope, even if it is the supplementary file from previous exercises.</p> <p>Sometimes, we might provide those require statements commented out; for instance if we recommend testing your programs with them but they aren’t required to complete the assignment. In those cases, it’s okay to use them to TEST your code, but you shouldn’t use those functions within your own function definitions.</p> <hr> <h2 id="what-part-of-starter-code-can-i-change">What part of starter code can I change?</h2> <p>You can replace ​”fill me in”​ with your work and write any new definitions. Other than that, you ​should not​ modify, delete or comment out existing definitions. You ​must not​ change provided struct definitions.</p> <hr> <h2 id="how-to-save-my-definitions">How to save my definitions?</h2> <p>When you hit <strong>control-s</strong> (Windows) or <strong>command-s</strong> (Mac), the changes to definitions will be saved. You can also choose File -&gt; Save Definitions.</p> <p>Caution: ​never ​use items in File -&gt; Save Other unless you are very certain about what’s happening. The files produced by “Save Interactions” or “Save Definitions as Text…” either don’t contain your code or are not runnable.</p> </main> </div> </body> </html>
