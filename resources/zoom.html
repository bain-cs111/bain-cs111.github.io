To do this, you will first navigate to <a href="https://northwestern.zoom.us" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">https://northwestern.zoom.us</a>, and then join the corresponding meeting.</p> <p>If you have not setup your NU Zoom account, please visit <a href="https://services.northwestern.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=140" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NU IT’s webpage</a> for more details.</p> <p>If you don’t login to zoom or if you are logged in as a user other than through the NU Single Sign-On, you won’t be able to join our Zoom rooms.</p> <h2 id="finding-your-zoom-link">Finding Your Zoom Link</h2> <p>We will have different zoom links for different kinds of activities. All zoom links corresponding to lectures, office hours, and labs will be made available via Canvas</p> <h2 id="recording-audio--video">Recording (Audio / Video)</h2> <p>We <strong>will</strong> be recording all Zoom sessions during if they are held during scheduled class time. We WILL NOT be recording office hours or lab sessions in order to protect students’ privacy.</p> <h2 id="etiquette">Etiquette</h2> <p>To ensure a smooth lecture experience for everyone, we’ll need to follow some simple guidelines.</p> <ol> <li>To protect your privacy and avoid outside disruptions, all class-related Zoom meetings will require authentication and be password-protected. You will need to connect to Zoom using Northwestern Single Sign-On (other Zoom accounts you may have will not work). Passwords will be available on the Canvas “Syllabus” page.</li> <li>Keep your audio and video muted at all times, unless you’re asking a question. Your audio and video should be muted by default when you join the lecture meetings.</li> <li>To ask a question (I love questions!), please use the “raise hand” feature of Zoom. In the “Participants” pane (opened using the “Participants” button at the bottom of the screen), there is a “raise hand” button. When you raise your hand, I will receive a pop-up, and will acknowledge your question as soon as appropriate.</li> <li>To ask your question, please unmute your audio (and video, if you want), ask, then mute yourself again. Repeat as needed for follow-ups.</li> <li>We will have a member of the course staff present during lectures to monitor the meeting and the chat. If you think I may not have noticed your question (give me a few moments), or if asking your question directly is an issue (e.g., you prefer not be to recorded, or do not have a microphone), send the staff member on duty a direct message using Zoom’s chat feature.</li> <li>To avoid audio feedback when you speak up, please use headphones during Zoom meetings.</li> <li>We may need to adapt the above and/or introduce new guidelines as the quarter goes on. But above all, we’re relying on everyone doing their part to ensure a conducive learning environment.</li> </ol> <p>Thank you for your cooperation!</p> </main> </div> </body> </html>
