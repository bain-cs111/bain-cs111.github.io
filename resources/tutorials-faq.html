Can I still submit the attendance form?</p> </blockquote> <p>YES. In fact, this is why we do attendance credit for the tutorials as if you’re participating fully in-person, odds are you’ll take much more time to complete the assignment than if you were working on it by yourself. We want you to practice talking about CS with each other. That’s why we have the tutorials.</p> <blockquote> <p>When do I fill out the attendance form?</p> </blockquote> <p>It should be the last thing you do in each tutorial session. If you finish early, before leaving the room you should fill it out. If you don’t make it to the end of the tutorial assignment, fill it out right at 10:50am before you leave the room.</p> <blockquote> <p>Can I do the tutorial on my own but still fill out the attendance form?</p> </blockquote> <p>If you fill out the attendance form as if you were physically in class, but are not actually physically present, it’s a serious academic honesty policy violation and there are significant penalties. Don’t do that. If you don’t want to or can’t attend a Tutorial, complete the assignment and submit via Canvas.</p> <blockquote> <p>I want to be a different Tutorial Team.</p> </blockquote> <p>We can move you to a different team. Just see Prof. Bain before/after class or during OH.</p> </main> </div> </body> </html>
