While it makes the submission process a little more seamless for students, it also has some drawbacks.</p> <p>First, it seems to randomly decide when to random “previews” of a student submission. If you see the below, it means your file was submitted but Canvas hasn’t yet gotten around to generating what the preview actually looks like:</p> <p><img style="width: 50%;" src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/images/canvas_submissions/still_loading.png" alt="still loading screenshot"></p> <p>It doesn’t actually seem to render <code>.rkt</code> files anymore at all. This new interface has also now made it actively more difficult to “double check” which file you submitted via the Submission page. If you want to see exactly what file you submitted you can do the following:</p> <ul> <li>Go to the Canvas files tab.</li> </ul> <p><img style="width: 50%;" src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/images/canvas_submissions/files_tab.png" alt="files tab screenshot"></p> <ul> <li>Click on the link at the bottom of the screen that says <code>All My Files</code> </li> </ul> <p><img style="width: 50%;" src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/images/canvas_submissions/all_my_files.png" alt="all my files screenshot"></p> <ul> <li>Go into the <code>Submissions</code> folder.</li> </ul> <p><img style="width: 50%;" src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/images/canvas_submissions/submissions.png" alt="submissions folder screenshot"></p> <ul> <li>Go into the <code>COMP_SCI 111</code> folder and you’ll see all of the files you’ve submitted in the class. The most recent file for each assignment is the one that we’ll grade.</li> </ul> <p><img style="width: 50%;" src="https://bain-cs111.github.io/assets/images/canvas_submissions/all_submissions.png" alt="all submissions screenshot"></p> </main> </div> </body> </html>
