Any assignment questions emailed directly to any member of the course staff will be forwarded to edSTEM</li> <li>If you have a question about code that requires you to show someone your code, you may submit a private post (just to the course staff) with your code (That said, PM office hours are usually more efficient for these sorts of questions)</li> </ul> <h3 id="other-questions">Other Questions</h3> <p>For any other issues that you think are not appropriate for the peer mentors or graduate TA, please talk to Prof. Bain. This might include things like concerns about your progress in the course, questions about content from lectures, personal matters related to your participation in the course, larger grade concerns, advice about future courses, majors, and internships, etc.</p> <h2 id="how-to-use-edstem">How to Use edSTEM</h2> <iframe src="https://northwestern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=a0bee2a6-7fca-44d9-b979-b1f40001c179&amp;autoplay=false&amp;offerviewer=true&amp;showtitle=true&amp;showbrand=true&amp;captions=true&amp;interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay" aria-label="Panopto Embedded Video Player" aria-description="(Optional) Intro to edSTEM"></iframe> </main> </div> </body> </html>
